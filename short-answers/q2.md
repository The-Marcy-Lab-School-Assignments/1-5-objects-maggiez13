# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
Pass by value involves passing a copy of the data to the function. So, any modifications made to the data within the function do not affect the original data outside of the function. 

When passing by reference, a reference to the original data is passed to the function. So, changes made to the data within the function will affect the original data outside of the function. Therefore, pass by reference allows for mutability.
