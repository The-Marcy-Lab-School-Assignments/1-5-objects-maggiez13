# Question
Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data representation format that allows for storing and transporting data. 

JSON supports strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects. 

The code provided is not valid JSON as the key values were not in quotations. The example would be valid if it looked like this: 
```js
{
  "name": "Zo",
  "isCool": true,
  "age": 28
}
```

# Teacher Feedback

Yup! The keys need to be in quotes!
