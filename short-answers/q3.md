# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
A shallow copy refers to specific values that are still connected to the original variable (Array or Object). Therefore, every change to a new variable will affect the original variable. Shallow copying can cause bugs because changes made to nested elements in the original object or array are reflected in the cloned object or array. To avoid such bugs, a solution would be to create a deep copy instead.
